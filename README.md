# Digidaniel Containers Library

Here I store all my public containers that I have writen, many of these container
I run myself or in different projects I work with and try to keep them up to date.

## How to use the images

All my images are pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and can be fetch from there
the format I try to use is consistent ex. `digidanieltech/APP:TAG` so it should be easy to find
the image you want to use.

## Docker Compose Example files

With each container I always try to add an complete docker-compose.yml example file so it is easy
to test the applikation before use and it can be found in this repo in it's own project folder.

## Contributing

If you find any problems or wish to help with adding images I would love the help, please submit a
pull request and I will look into it ASAP.

## License

All images I write is under MIT license and is free to do what every you want with, I do this for
fun not for profit.
